Description: This package provides a pipeline for analysis of GC-MS
        data acquired in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The tool
        also provides a guidance in choosing appropriate fragments for
        the targets of interest by using an optimization algorithm.
        This is done by considering overlapping peaks from a provided
        library by the user.
